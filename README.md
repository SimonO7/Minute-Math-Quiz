### Description:
A math quiz game created in Javascript, based on a similar paper math quiz called Hot Pencil or Mad Minute, used by many teachers in elementary schools for students typically in grades 1-5 to build basic math knowledge.

The goal of this game is simple: answer as many randomly generated math questions correctly as you can in one minute.

### How to play:
1. Choose the operations and level of difficulty.
2. Press Start.
3. Answer the math question on the screen! Press Enter to submit the answer. The answer may be a positive or negative integer (no decimal numbers or fractions).
4. If the answer is correct, a new question will appear.
5. If the answer is incorrect, you have to answer it again correctly before you can move to next question.

### Levels and Supported Operations:
#### Levels
Each math question is randomly generated with two operands, based on the difficulty level and operations selected by the player.

The level of difficulty determines the range of numbers used for each operand. 

There are 3 levels of difficulty:
- Easy: single digit numbers (1-99) by single digit numbers (1-9)
- Medium: double digit numbers (1-99) by single digits (1-9)
- Hard: double digits (1-99) by double digits (1-99)

#### Operations
Currently, only addition, subtraction, and multiplication questions are supported.

You may choose which of the 3 types operations will appear in the questions, and can enable/disable as you wish. For example, if you want to only do addition questions, you can turn off subtraction and multiplication questions from the options screen before starting the game.
